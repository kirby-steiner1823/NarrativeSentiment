My earliest math memories begin sitting at the table late at night (8 p.m.) when I was young thinking about how difficult it was while my dad understood it with ease. Growing up in a very athletic and competitive family, I always wanted to be the very best at everything and when I didn’t get something or if I wasn’t the very best at it my confidence / self-esteem would plummet. Unlike most, I like math and growing up it came easy to me, for the most part. I enjoyed figuring out fractions and doing flashcard multiplication. Looking forward to the timed multiplication quizzes each week came naturally. I find myself telling others that I’m actually good at math just to seem more valid or as if because I’m good at decimals, that is equivalent to me being a great person. Having good grades and performing well academically has always come easy and been extremely important to me. If the class or subject is difficult, I don’t give myself the benefit of the doubt and I still strive for the best grade possible. So much of my validation as a person comes from my grades and how I perform in sports to the point where I have no clue what will happen when I’m done with both. Growing up at the kitchen table not understanding subtraction to now understanding and working out problems is a lot to think about. Asking for peoples help when I don’t understand something has always made me feel like an idiot. I don’t know where I’m going with this but I'm excited for the class!!!
